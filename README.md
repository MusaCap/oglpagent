# Musa Thought Leadership Engine

The Musa Thought Leadership Engine is an application designed to streamline and enhance the creation of insightful LinkedIn articles and newsletter content. Its primary purpose is to position Musa Capital as a leading pre-seed venture capital fund by leveraging industry news and aligning it with Musa Capital's event calendar (managed via Luma). The generated content will target Musa Capital's Newsletter OGs and LPs, subtly promoting relevant events.

## Problem Solved

This tool aims to solve:
*   The manual effort and time required to scan multiple news sources for relevant topics.
*   The challenge of consistently aligning content with Musa Capital's event calendar and pre-seed investment focus.
*   The need to efficiently generate initial drafts for thought leadership pieces.

## Key MVP Features

*   **News Source Aggregation:**
    *   **Primary:** Integration with **Crunchbase API** for structured VC news, funding rounds, and company information.
    *   **Backup/Supplemental:** Integration with **NewsAPI.org** for broader keyword-based news searches from various publications.
    *   Support for manually adding and scanning **RSS Feeds** from specific VC blogs and publications.
*   **Luma Calendar Integration:** Connect to Musa Capital's Luma calendar to fetch upcoming events.
*   **Topic-Event Matching:** Intelligent suggestions linking relevant news articles to upcoming Musa Capital events.
*   **AI-Assisted Content Generation:** Leverage AI (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models) to produce:
    *   Summaries of news articles.
    *   Potential angles and talking points.
    *   Suggested headlines.
    *   Initial drafts (200-300 words) incorporating news, Musa's pre-seed perspective, and event mentions.
*   **Content Editing & Refinement:** A rich-text editor to review, modify, and finalize generated content.
*   **Content Export:** Export finalized content in formats suitable for LinkedIn (Markdown/HTML) and newsletters.

## Technology Stack (High-Level - See Recommendations for Details)

*   **Backend:** Node.js (with Express.js or NestJS)
*   **Frontend:** React (with Next.js or Create React App)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended) or MongoDB
*   **AI:** OpenAI API (or similar LLM provider)
*   **Scheduling:** node-cron or a more robust queue system (e.g., BullMQ with Redis)
*   **Deployment:** Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure (or platform like Vercel/Netlify for frontend)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL running locally or in Docker)
*   **API Keys:**
    *   Crunchbase API Key
    *   NewsAPI.org API Key (for backup)
    *   OpenAI API Key
    *   Luma API Key (if applicable, or prepare for iCal/manual integration)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd musa-thought-leadership-engine
    ```

2.  **Set up Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # or your backend directory name
    npm install # or yarn install

    # Create a .env file based on .env.example
    cp .env.example .env

    # Populate .env with your database credentials and API keys:
    # Example .env content:
    # DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
    # CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY="your_crunchbase_api_key"
    # NEWSAPI_ORG_API_KEY="your_newsapi_org_key"
    # LUMA_API_KEY="your_luma_key" # (if applicable)
    # JWT_SECRET="your_strong_jwt_secret"
    ```

3.  **Set up Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # or your frontend directory name
    npm install # or yarn install

    # Create a .env.local file if needed for frontend-specific environment variables
    # Example:
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:BACKEND_PORT/api"
    ```

4.  **Database Setup (Backend):**
    *   Ensure your database server is running.
    *   Run database migrations (command will depend on the ORM used, e.g., `npx prisma migrate dev` or `npm run migrate`):
        ```bash
        # cd backend
        # Example for Prisma:
        # npx prisma migrate dev --name initial-setup
        # Example for Sequelize:
        # npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
        ```
    *   (Optional) Run seed scripts if available to populate initial data:
        ```bash
        # npm run seed
        ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev # or npm start
    ```
    The backend server will typically start on a port like `3001` or `5000`. Check your backend `package.json`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # or npm start
    ```
    The frontend will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or your frontend port) in your browser.

## Running Tests

*   **Backend Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm test
    ```
*   **Frontend Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm test
    ```

## Deployment

Deployment strategies will vary based on the chosen cloud provider and services. Consider containerizing the application using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.
*   **Backend:** Deploy as a Node.js application (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku, or a Docker container on ECS/Kubernetes).
*   **Frontend:** Deploy as a static site or Node.js server (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3/CloudFront, or a Docker container).
