## 1. Introduction
The Musa Thought Leadership Engine is an application designed to streamline and enhance the creation of insightful LinkedIn articles and newsletter content. Its primary purpose is to position Musa Capital as a leading pre-seed venture capital fund by leveraging industry news and aligning it with Musa Capital's event calendar (managed via Luma). The generated content will target Musa Capital's Newsletter OGs (Original Gangsters/Key Supporters) and LPs (Limited Partners), subtly promoting relevant events.

## 7. Data Sources & Integration

*   **Input:**
    *   Industry News APIs/RSS Feeds (`Crunchbase`, `TechCrunch`, etc.)
    *   Luma Calendar (API preferred, `iCal`/`CSV` fallback)
    *   Musa Capital specific inputs: Investment thesis keywords, core pre-seed investor messaging points, past successful articles (for style learning in later versions).
*   **Output:**
    *   Text/Markdown/HTML content for LinkedIn and Newsletters.

---

## 8. Technology Stack Considerations (High-Level)

*   **Backend:** Python (`Django`/`Flask`) or Node.js (`Express`) are common choices for web apps and API integrations.
*   **Frontend:** `React`, `Vue`, or `Angular` for a dynamic user interface.
*   **Database:** `PostgreSQL` or `MongoDB`.
*   **AI/NLP:**
    *   OpenAI API (`GPT-3.5`/`GPT-4`) for content generation and summarization.
    *   Libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` for text processing if building custom NLP components.
*   **Hosting:** `AWS`, `Google Cloud`, `Azure`.

---

## 9. Design & UX Considerations

*   **Simplicity:** The interface should be intuitive for non-technical marketing users.
*   **Clarity:** Clearly display suggested topics, news sources, and event tie-ins.
*   **Control:** Users must have full control over editing and finalizing content. The AI is an assistant, not a replacement.
*   **Branding:** The tool's output should subtly but effectively reinforce Musa Capital's brand.

---

    *   Number of articles/newsletter pieces generated per week/month.
    *   Time saved in content creation process (user surveys/estimates).

    *   Qualitative feedback from LPs/OGs on content insightfulness.

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Reliability:** Consistent uptime and accurate news aggregation.
*   **Security:** Protection of API keys and any sensitive Musa Capital data.
*   **Scalability:** Ability to handle an increasing number of news sources and users.
*   **Maintainability:** Codebase should be well-documented and easy to update (e.g., change AI models, update news source parsers).

---

## 12. Assumptions

*   Access to APIs for key news sources (or reliable scraping methods can be developed).
*   Luma calendar provides a usable API or export format.
*   Budget is available for AI API usage (e.g., OpenAI).
*   Human oversight and editing will always be part of the content creation workflow.

---

## 13. Open Questions

*   What is the definitive list of initial news sources to integrate?
*   What are the specific API availabilities and limitations for Luma and news sources?
*   What is the estimated budget for development and ongoing operational costs (e.g., AI API fees)?
*   Who will be the primary day-to-day operator of the tool?
*   What is the desired level of AI "autonomy" vs. "assistance" in the MVP? (Current PRD leans heavily on "assistance").
*   Are there existing internal documents outlining Musa Capital's "pre-seed perspective" or core messaging that can be used to prime the AI?
